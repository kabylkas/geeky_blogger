# GeekyBlogger
GeekBlogger is a static web page generator for blogging. You provide the text and some images. Run the script. Push the generated pages to the repo. Here is the example of my blog page: [https://kabylkas.github.io/blog/](https://kabylkas.github.io/blog/)

I like spending some time to pour out my thoughts and projects to paper. Thoughts are abstract. Writing allows to serialize the thoughts. Also, suprisingly, I found that some of my writings were beneficial to some people. So why not?

However, finding the right platform for blogging is hard. I tried many things and I didn't like any of them. Most of the platforms (for example WordPress) are freaking huge and have bunch unnecessary stuff attached to it! Also, most of the blogging platforms are dynamic which require you to spend money on a webserver. 

I need something simple and cheap!
